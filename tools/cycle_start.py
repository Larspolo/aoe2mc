"""Steps 1 to 5 of the `autopilot` skill in one call: it prints only what needs work (owner, 2026-10-28).

The start of a ticket took about 13 tool calls in each run (status issue, usage line, stuck tickets, each open PR, the
CI of main, owner feedback, triage, the pick list), 19 % of the calls of four runs on 2026-10-28. Each call reads the
whole context again. This tool reads all of it and prints one short section per step.

    python3 tools/cycle_start.py                # at the start of a run and before each later ticket
    python3 tools/cycle_start.py --lane haiku   # the pick list of the Haiku lane
    python3 tools/cycle_start.py --last N       # a later ticket of the run: within a priority, the tickets of the
                                                # same epic or files as ticket N first

Sections: `Status` (exit 3 when the status issue has `paused`: stop; the time and the values of `agent.toml` that the
skill needs: repo, owner, branch), `Usage` (keep the line for the report of step 8),
`Stuck` (`claim.py 0 --stuck`), `Flow brake` (`usage.py --flow`), `PRs` (the open agent PRs that need work: red CI,
a conflict, a closed ticket, or green and not merged after 10 minutes), `Main CI` (the last run and the last night run),
`Feedback` (`feedback.py`), `Triage` (open issues without a priority label), `Candidates` (the pick order of
`dashboard.py --next`, without the tickets that a run holds; the first 8 of the top priority group turned by the
branch name, so that parallel runs try other first picks, #3832; and the `claim.py N --or M ...` command of the first 5) and `Release checks` (only when a check can start and has
no ticket, `release.due()`). The skill says what to do with each line.
