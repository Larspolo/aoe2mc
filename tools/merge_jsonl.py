"""Git merge driver for the data tables `game/data/*.jsonl`: merge the lines by their key "name" (#2004).

`merge=union` keeps the old and the new version of a line that one side changed, and `table.load()` then stops
("more than one line for X", #1890, #1934). This driver takes, for each name, the side that changed it. A line that
both sides changed merges key by key, also in nested objects, and a list of unique names merges name by name when
each side only adds or only removes names (#2064: two new units in the "missing" lists of almost all lines of
civs.jsonl). A key that both sides changed to different values, or a list that one side changed in place (the pair
"upgrade"), is a conflict: the file gets conflict markers around the two lines and the exit code is 1.
The line order comes from the side that moved lines (some tables are choice lists in file order); two different moves
are a conflict around the whole files (#3065).

    python3 tools/merge_jsonl.py BASE OURS THEIRS     # git: merge.jsonl.driver "python3 tools/merge_jsonl.py %O %A %B"

The result goes into OURS. A line without a JSON object with "name" is keyed by its text (a union without copies).
A file that does not parse falls back to the text merge of `git merge-file`.
