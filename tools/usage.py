"""The quota usage of the Claude subscription, and the number of runs that uses it (owner request, 2026-10-26).

The aim (owner, 2026-10-26): 90 % of the 5-hour window used 2 hours before its reset, then slower to 98 % at the
reset, so that each window reaches the limit (#587).

    python3 tools/usage.py              # five_hour 30% (resets 06:30 UTC, 2.0 h) · seven_day 30% ... · target 12 runs
    python3 tools/usage.py --target     # only the number of runs (rule 4 of the scheduled task)
    python3 tools/usage.py --json
    python3 tools/usage.py --sample     # Usage: <now> · usage 30.0% · resets <time> · runs 9 · week 56.0% · release 61.2%
    python3 tools/usage.py --fire       # the number of runs that the pacer starts now (`tools/pacer.py`, #3193)
    python3 tools/usage.py --flow       # exit 1 when the flow brake is on: the runs repair PRs, no new ticket

The flow brake (owner, 2026-10-27): the quota is not the only bottleneck. When CI, merge conflicts or anything else
stops the merges, the agent PRs build up, and a night of new PRs gives many conflicts. So `--fire` counts the open
agent PRs older than `pr_minutes` (they wait for something that is not the quota) and the queued CI runs. At
`max_waiting_prs` it starts at most 1 run per cycle, and that run only repairs PRs (autopilot step 2). At
`max_ci_queue` it starts no run: a run cannot make CI faster. The limits are in `[pacing]` of `agent.toml`.

BURN and BURN7 (the same for the 7-day window, #1695) are the defaults. When the run reports on the status issue
have enough `Usage:` lines (at least 5 pairs in the last 24 hours), `tools/health.py` measures the burns from them
and this tool uses those values (#462).

The CLI reports the usage of the subscription in a `rate_limit_event` of its stream-json output. One tiny Haiku
call reads it, about 1 s and a few tokens. All runs share one quota, so each run sees the same numbers.
The pure functions take plain values, so the tests need no network.
