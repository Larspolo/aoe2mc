"""Claim a ticket with a git ref, so that two runs cannot take the same ticket (#211).

A comment or a label never fails when another run was first. A push without force to a new ref fails when the
ref exists, so the ref `claim/N` decides who owns ticket N. The claim commit has no parent and a unique message:
a second push of another claim commit is never a fast-forward. Later claims of the same ticket use
`claim/N-2`, `claim/N-3` ...: the ref with the highest number owns the ticket.

    python3 tools/claim.py N              # claim ticket N; exit 0: yours (it adds `in-progress` and "Started by",
                                          # and prints the ticket and its comments, #3459),
                                          # exit 1: it names the run that was first
    python3 tools/claim.py N --or M K     # the same, and when another run has N, try M, then K, in this one call
    python3 tools/claim.py N --release    # give your claim back (needs-human, blocked, hand-off); it removes
                                          # `in-progress` (#3234)
    python3 tools/claim.py N --takeover   # take the ticket from a dead run (stale or released claim, #502)

                                          # 10 minutes when its PR has the label `conflict` (#1773)
    python3 tools/claim.py 0 --stuck      # list the `in-progress` tickets of stopped runs (no beat for 30 minutes)
    python3 tools/claim.py N --guard      # before each push: beat, and exit 1 when a PR of another branch closes N

    python3 tools/claim.py ID --comment   # lock owner comment ID (autopilot step 3); exit 1: another run handles it
    python3 tools/claim.py E --refill     # lock the sub-issues of epic E (0: the whole queue refill, autopilot step 5)
    python3 tools/claim.py 0 --fixmain --state SHA   # lock the "Fix main" ticket of the break in commit SHA (step 2)
    python3 tools/claim.py 0 --review     # lock the process review after its gap of merged PRs (`improve` skill,
                                          # `[review]` of `steering/system/system.toml`; it prints the owner work since the last review)
    python3 tools/claim.py 0 --reviewed change   # after the review: "change" or "none" sets the next gap
    python3 tools/claim.py 0 --roadmap    # lock the review of steering/project/ROADMAP.md after 100 merged PRs (`roadmap` skill)
    python3 tools/claim.py 0 --prune      # delete the refs of closed tickets and old locks (`claims.yml` only)

Two runs did one ticket (#288): one commented "Started by" and worked without the claim ref. So a claim also fails
when another branch commented "Started by" in the last 30 minutes or has an active PR for the ticket (#491), and `--guard` stops a run before its push when it does not own the claim or another branch has a PR for the ticket. The GitHub checks run only for a GitHub remote.

A usage limit stops all runs at about the same time, and a stopped run never continues (#231). Its last beat is
before the stop, so its ticket is stale at most 30 minutes after the limit resets. A live run beats again.

Three runs read one owner comment at the same time and made three copies of one epic (#320). So a run locks a
comment before it acts on it: `--comment` pushes `claim/comment-ID` once (no slots, no release).
Three runs refilled the queue of one epic within 2 minutes and made copies of tickets (#505). So a run locks the
refill before it makes tickets: `--refill` pushes `claim/refill-E-S` once. S is the state of the work: the number of
closed sub-issues of epic E (a new lock when a sub-issue closes), or the UTC hour and its 10-minute slot for E = 0
(the whole refill), for a ticket E with no sub-issue (#855) and for an epic E with all sub-issues closed (its count
cannot change any more, #3057). A slot lock `N-<slot>` also holds the count lock `N`: the first new sub-issue of
that run changes the state to N, and a second run made the same sub-issues again (#3454).
One break of main gave 8 "Fix main" tickets in 6 minutes (#3480). So a run locks the ticket before it makes it:
`--fixmain` pushes `claim/fixmain-SHA` once (SHA: the commit that broke main, default the head of `origin/main`). All
lanes use it: a red main stops all runs.

Parallel runs read the same `runs` counter of the status issue, so "every 5th run" lost 7 of 10 process reviews
(#898). So `--review` locks one review: `claim/review-<gap>pr-<last review>-<k>`, and only when `gap` PRs merged after
the last review (`last_review` in the state comment of #1). A review with no change doubles the gap (50, 100, 200
merged PRs), a change sets it back to 50 (`--reviewed`). `--roadmap` locks the roadmap review the same way, 100 merged
PRs after `last_roadmap` or its newest lock ref (#3352: a write of the body can be lost), 30 while the refill has no
source (#3741). A gap counts merged PRs, not minutes: the speed of the project changes (#2039). The other times of this tool stay in seconds: a run that stopped
merges nothing, so only the clock finds it.

Exit 2: git failed for another reason (network, permission). The workflow `claims.yml` deletes the refs
of a closed ticket: the session proxy gives 403 for branch deletes. `--prune` does it with git and one API call (the
open issues): the workflow read each ref and each ticket by REST, about 60 calls a run and 44 runs an hour, and the
token of the workflows ran out of its hourly limit (2026-10-29). It also deletes the locks older than `LOCK_DAYS`.
