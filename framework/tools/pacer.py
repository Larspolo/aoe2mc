"""The pacer as a script (#3193): start the autopilot runs that the quota target misses, with no Claude session.

The old pacer session kept an old "cap of 4 per cycle" in its context and fired 4 Haiku runs for H = 8
(2026-10-28, #3147; removed in #3427). A script has no memory: `.github/workflows/pacer.yml` runs it every 10 minutes
while the key `pacer` in `[pacing]` of `steering/system/system.toml` is "workflow" (any other value stops the loop: a PR changes it).

    python3 framework/tools/pacer.py              # compute K and the lane runs (`usage.fire`), then start them
    python3 framework/tools/pacer.py --dry-run    # print the calls, send nothing
    python3 framework/tools/pacer.py --log F      # also add the record of the cycle to F, one JSON line (`record`)
    python3 framework/tools/pacer.py --switch     # exit 0 while the loop runs, 3 to stop it, 1 when the key is missing (`switch`)
    python3 framework/tools/pacer.py --secrets    # the JSON list of the secret names that pacer.yml reads (`secret_names`)

Each scheduled task has an API trigger (a URL and a token, made in the Claude app). The environment gives them:
`PACER_URL_MAIN` and `PACER_TOKEN_MAIN` for the main task, `PACER_URL_<LANE>` and `PACER_TOKEN_<LANE>` for each lane of
`weights` in `[pacing]` of `steering/system/system.toml`. A lane without a URL gets no runs: its tickets wait.
Several Claude accounts (#4237, `accounts`): another account NAME has `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN_<NAME>`,
`PACER_URL_<NAME>_<TASK>` and `PACER_TOKEN_<NAME>_<TASK>` (`secret_names`: pacer.yml reads them by name). Each account
gets its own quota read, target and claims (`account_targets`); the global limits of `usage.fire` cap the sum of the
missing runs, and `assign` gives each run to the account with the most missing runs. With one account the plan is the
same as before.
Exit 1 when a call fails: the workflow run goes red. HTTP 429 is no failure: a task takes at most 30 starts per hour,
an account 100 API starts per hour (the docs of the scheduled tasks, "Usage and limits"); the next cycle starts the
runs that the target still misses. No retry: each call that succeeds starts a run, so a retry can start two. When a
lane task is at its limit, the main task gets the blocked runs, up to the main runs of a new plan without that lane:
the Haiku lane got all 8 runs of each cycle, 48 an hour (2026-10-28).

The pacer also does steps 1 to 5 of the autopilot skill for the runs that it starts (owner, 2026-10-29: the runs
must do as little as possible). For each run it takes the next candidate of its lane in the pick order of
`dashboard.candidates`, claims it for the run (`claim.py` with the name `pacer-r<hex>`: the run has no branch yet),
and sends a brief in the `text` of the call: the ticket, its comments, the code places (`ticket_context.context`) and
the `Usage:` line of the report. The run adopts the claim with its first beat (`claim.py N --adopt NAME`) and starts at
step 6 (the `scheduled` skill). The brief is data in a `<routine-fire-payload>` block: the run takes only its
`ticket` and `claim` lines, and the claim ref in git proves them. The fire queues the brief as the second turn of a new
session, after the stored prompt: the first turn ends at once when it finds it (`tokens.py --queued`, #4550). A run with no candidate (a refill run), and all runs
while the flow brake is on or the last CI run on main is red, get no brief: they do steps 1 to 5 themselves. When a
call fails, the pacer releases the claim of its run.
A stuck ticket (`claim.py 0 --stuck`: its run stopped) comes before the candidates (autopilot step 2): the pacer takes
it over for one run (`claim.py N --takeover` with the run name) and adds a `takeover:` line with the branch of its PR.
Runs with no brief raced for the same stuck PRs, and each lost race cost a cycle start (#4356).
A stuck ticket whose PR only waits for its quick CI or for Automerge gets no takeover (`ci_wait`, #4932); a green
one starts the Automerge sweep: 10 of 14 takeovers "after the report" closed by the merge 0 to 18 minutes later.
